Contributing
============

You can contribute to the project with issues or pull requests.

Issues
------

Issues include bugs, build errors, and feature requests.  You can file
issues through the [Issues](https://github.com/zmthy/http-media/issues)
page.  Please ensure that a duplicate of your issue has not already been
filed, and provide as much relevant information as possible.

Pull Requests
-------------

To submit a contribution to the project, send a [Pull Request](https://
github.com/zmthy/http-media/pulls).  Submitted code should be formatted with
[ormolu](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ormolu). All of the tests must
pass, and Haddock documentation coverage should be at 100%.  Summarise your
change at the top of the `CHANGES.md` log.

Git commit messages must follow the standard of a one-line summary of at
most 50 characters (with no final period), and at least one following
paragraph preceded by a blank line and with a width of at most 72
characters.  The summary should begin with an imperative verb
(e.g. "Fix", not "Fixed" or "Fixes").  Each commit should map to a
single change, neither too granular or too coarse, and a pull request
should be rebased against the master branch.

Copyright
---------

You retain the copyright to your submission.  Contributing implies that
you own the copyright or you have permission to submit the work, you
agree to the use of the submission content in the project, and you
accept the terms of the project's license.
