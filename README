This library is intended to be a comprehensive solution to correctly using the
HTTP Accept header, as well as the related headers Accept-Charset and
Accept-Encoding. It encodes MIME parameters into the media type data, and allows
the matching of the final header value by comparing quality values from both the
client and the server.
